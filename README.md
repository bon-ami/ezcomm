# EZComm

TCP/UDP, client & server all-in-one, with UI or flow script.

## Getting started

 - It uses [fyne](https://fyne.io/) for graphical UI to support cross-platforms.
 - Run it with "-h" to show command line parameters.
 - Run it with "-flow" parameter with flow file name to run with no graphical UI but the script only. Refer to sample.xml to check how to write a flow script.
